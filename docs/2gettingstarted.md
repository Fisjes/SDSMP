# Getting Started

Welcome to the server! Before joining you'll need to set up our custom modpack. Follow the steps below and you'll be in within a few minutes.

## 1. Download a Launcher
You'll need a launcher that supports `.mrpack` files. We recommend [Modrinth App](https://modrinth.com/app) or [Prism Launcher](https://prismlauncher.org/).

## 2. Download the Modpack
Download our modpack file (latest version) (`.mrpack`) from [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/16eZNLFszhhfjhiyhWASu8aViN3Skcvkw?usp=sharing). <!-- Replace # with your actual download link -->

## 3. Import the Modpack

**Modrinth App**
1. Open the Modrinth App
2. Click **Add Instance** or the **+** button
3. Select **Import from file**
4. Select the `.mrpack` file you downloaded

**Prism Launcher**
1. Open Prism Launcher
2. Click **Add Instance**
3. Select **Import from zip**
4. Select the `.mrpack` file you downloaded

## 4. Launch the Game
Make sure the instance is using **Fabric** on **Minecraft 1.21.4** — it should be set automatically. Hit **Play** and let it load.

## 5. Join the Server
Once you're in the main menu, go to **Multiplayer** and add our server address:
```
play.masmp.nl
```
Or for IPV6
```
209.25.141.28:3417
```

That's it, you're in. If you run into any issues reach out to a staff member.
