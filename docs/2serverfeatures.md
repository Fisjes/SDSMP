# Server Features

## Economy
We use an emerald-based economy system. Emeralds are exchangeable for **Softcoins**, our server currency, at a rate of 1 emerald = 10 Softcoins. Use `/exchange <amount>` or just `/exchange` to convert all your emeralds at once. You can earn, trade and spend Softcoins across the server.

## Auctioning
Put items up for auction using `/auction start <amount> <price>` or `/auction hand <price>` to auction everything in your hand. Other players can bid using `/bid` (auto-bids current + 10) or `/bid <amount>` for a custom amount. The highest bidder when the timer runs out wins the item. Sellers can cancel their own auction at any time with `/auction stop`.

## Land Claiming
Protect your builds with [Flan](https://modrinth.com/mod/flan). Claim your territory and control exactly who is allowed to build on your land.

## Custom Avatars with Figura
We have [Figura](https://modrinth.com/mod/figura) installed, a client-side mod that lets you create, import and wear fully custom 3D avatars. Make yourself look however you want.

## Painting with Joy of Painting
[Joy of Painting](https://modrinth.com/mod/joy-of-painting) lets you paint your own custom paintings and hang them on walls like actual art. Decorate your base however you like.

## Waystones & Warp Pads
Getting around is easy with [Waystones](https://modrinth.com/mod/waystones). Teleport to towns, bases and points of interest without the hassle of travelling.

## Block Customization with Rechiseled
[Rechiseled](https://modrinth.com/mod/rechiseled) lets you alter the patterns of almost any block, giving you way more variety and detail in your builds.

## Terralith World Generation
Our world uses [Terralith](https://modrinth.com/mod/terralith), an advanced terrain generator that overhauls world generation and adds over 100 new biomes to explore.

## Home & Teleport Commands
Set personal home points with `/home set [name]` and teleport back anytime. Use `/tpa` to request a teleport to another player, or `/tpahere` to request they come to you.

## Proximity Voice Chat
We have [Simple Voice Chat](https://modrinth.com/mod/simple-voice-chat) set up, which lets you talk to players near you in-game via proximity chat. The closer you are, the louder they sound.
