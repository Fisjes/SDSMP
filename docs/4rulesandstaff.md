# Rules, Staff Help and Bans

If you need help from a staff member, reach out via our Discord or message a staff member in-game. For ban appeals, see the appeals section below.

## Treat everyone with respect.
Do not be rude or hostile towards other players, whether it is outside or inside the server. Causing too much trouble/toxicity can result in a permanent ban. Keep it chill with each other.

## No griefing or stealing.
Griefing player builds will result in a permanent ban. No appeals. This server is about creating and building cool stuff with each other, so destroying or stealing other people's work is strictly prohibited.

> **Note:** We use [CoreProtect](https://modrinth.com/plugin/coreprotect) to log all block and inventory changes. Every block placed, broken or stolen is tracked and can be rolled back. Do not think you can get away with it.

## No cheating!
We do allow some client-sided mods like world maps, mini maps and waypoints. But nothing that would speed up the gameplay's progression or give you an unfair advantage.

Please do not utilize the F3 debug screen to find certain biomes, caves, structures or the end portal. If we catch you doing this you will be temporarily banned.

**Allowed mods include:**
- [Xaero's Minimap](https://modrinth.com/mod/xaeros-minimap)
- [Xaero's World Map](https://modrinth.com/mod/xaeros-world-map)
- [Sodium](https://modrinth.com/mod/sodium) / performance mods
- Waypoint mods

**Not allowed:**
- X-ray or cave finders
- Speed, fly or reach hacks
- Auto clickers or macros
- Any mod that automates gameplay or gives positional advantages beyond what is listed above

## Do not evade bans.
Ban evasion is a severe offence and will result in a permanent ban for all of your accounts. This includes logging in on an alt account while banned.

## Keep your builds appropriate.
We understand that some artwork may be suggestive, and that is fine. But do not make artwork that includes nudity. This will result in a ban.

## Keep mod use appropriate.
We use a client-side mod named [Figura](https://modrinth.com/mod/figura), which lets you import, make and modify your own custom 3D avatars. We ask you to keep these avatars appropriate. Suggestive content like artwork is allowed, just no nudity.

## Avoid lagging the server.
We ask you to *please* keep mob farms and villager trading halls away from spawn or towns. Oversized farms that cause significant server lag may be removed without warning.

**General guidelines:**
- Keep mob farms at least **200 blocks** from spawn or any town
- Limit your farms to a reasonable size
- Avoid running massive redstone contraptions 24/7 near other players

## Ban Appeals
If you believe your ban was issued unfairly, you may appeal by reaching out to a staff member on Discord. Provide your username, the reason you were given and why you believe it should be reversed. Note that bans for griefing are **permanent with no appeal.**

## Reporting Players
If you witness a player breaking any of the rules above, please report them to a staff member via Discord or in-game with as much detail as possible. Screenshots or screen recordings are helpful.
